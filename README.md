# Deploy to GitHub pages
To deploy you need to first build it, even if you were serving it before - like if you were just running `npm start` or `npm run start`.  

Procedure to deploy:  
`npm run build`  
`npm run deploy`  

Check in GitHub if [action was triggered](https://github.com/sagasu/space-x-explorer/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages) - it may take some time < 1 min but often > 30s :)
